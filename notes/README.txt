The important file are:
- run_simulations.m
 (the starting point, making a loop to get data for different experimental paradigm parameters)
- dinausaur2.m 
(that set up the simulation, the experimental paradigm / input, the DNF model and its parameters)
- rnn_ode_u_A_fast.m 
(that basically applies the Euler method to the DNF)
